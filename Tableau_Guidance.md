## Week 3: Tableau, Project
### Objectives, students will be able to:
- Create and showcase an interactive Tableau dashboard on Tableau Public

### Instructions
**Step 1**: Go to [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) to download the app. Tableau Public is a _public_ version of Tableau Desktop. The main difference is that Public saves your content to the _cloud_ and Desktop allows you to save files _locally_. Follow the necessary steps to install Tableau Public on your computer.

**Step 2**: Create an account on [data.world](https://data.world/)

**Step 3**: Open Tableau Public, on the Connect tab, Under "To a Server", click "more", then search "web" and from the returned results, click "Web Data Connector"

**Step 4**: In the "Web Data Connector" box type "tableau.data.world" and then enter. Follow all directions to connect Tableau to data.world.

**Step 5**: Search for the "Austin Animal Center" datasets published by the city of Austin. Follow the directions to add the  outcomes dataset as a connection to your Tableau Workbook.

**Step 6**: Repat step 4, but with the "intakes" dataset. The resulting Tableau Public workbook should have two connections, each containing one table.

**Step 7**: Join the tables on Animal Id

**Step 8**: Create a meaningful dashboard that would allow admins at the center to track admissions of dogs and cats from the past 3 years (2020 inclusive) and find any meaningful patters involving breed and age to help them get more animals adopted.

**Step 9**: Publish your dashboard on Tableau Public, and add link to your portfolio.
